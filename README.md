# Grade-Calculator
This is a simple Python program that calculates the average grade based on the grades you input. It also determines whether the student has passed or failed based on the average score.

## How It Works
1. The program asks the user how many grades they want to input.
2. It then collects each grade, one by one, and stores them in a list.
3. After all grades are entered, it calculates the average of all grades.
4. Finally, it checks if the average grade is 60 or more:
   - 60 or above, it displays "passed."
   - below 60, it displays "failed."
